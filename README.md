# Project Mantis:  *Hacking Back the AI-Hacker*
## Prompt Injection as a Defense Against LLM-driven Cyberattacks

ðŸ”¨ We are currently populating this repository. ðŸªš

## Install Mantis

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Mantis with pre-made configurations
Various pre-made configurations are available in the ```./confs``` directory.

### Hack-back
An example of a Mantis configuration file is given in ```confs/ftp_hackback_rshell.py```. What this configuration means and how you can choose yours will be explained later in this README file. This can be run using the ```mantis_run.py``` script:
```
python mantis_run.py 10.129.178.62 confs.ftp_hackback_rshell 
```
where ```10.129.178.62``` must be replaced with the host IP (either local or public). 

Running Mantis with ```confs/ftp_hackback_rshell.py``` will spawn an FTP decoy server with anonymous credentials that aims to trick the attacking LLM-agent into opening a reverse shell.
